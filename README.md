# HeXXen 1733 Foundry VTT System

A HeXXen 1733 game system for Foundry VTT.

Under construction. Currently provides a rudimentary Jaeger sheet and an integration of a roll tool.
Currently the roll tool requires the module https://github.com/Bapf/foundryvtt-special-dice-roller to be installed and activated.
  
It is strongly recommended that you install from the stable branch! Master branch is subject of ongoing development and can break at any time. New features will be available in stable as soon as they seem usable, so there is no need to install from master branch.
